        %p.description Rob Conery released the final episode of his “Playing With Backbone” screencast series. Episode #10 takes the existing “Congo” app that Rob built throughout the series, and migrates it from his custom Backbone views over to MarionetteJS, with my help. Better still, Rob has made this episode free for everyone to view!

        %p.description
          Tuts+ Premium has a good series on “Advanced Backbone Patterns And Practices“, with a free episode that covers an introduction to Marionette. This episode focuses on bring the most value to your Backbone app, quickly, by looking at the various views that Marionette provides, along with Regions to display the views in the DOM.

          The majority of this series is paid, but there are a few free ones including the MarionetteJS episode. It’s a great episode but it’s only 10 minutes. So you can expect it to give you an idea of what Marionette can do for your app, without getting too in-depth.
